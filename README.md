# Grid Reliability Statistics
A collection of statistical and descriptive summaries of NERC GADS data.


## Overview
This repository is envisioned to house a collection of statistical and descriptive summaries of [NERC GADS](https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/gads/Pages/GeneratingAvailabilityDataSystem-(GADS).aspx) data, particularly summaries that on their own might be insufficient to warrant publication. In addition, it is intended to disseminate results rather than to enable reproduction as GADS is non-public.


## Notebooks
### Blackstart analysis (blackstart.ipynb)
This notebook tabulates blackstart capability by generator type.

### Scheduled outage factors (scheduled_outages.ipynb)
This notebook tabulates equivalent scheduled outage factors by NERC region and generator type.
